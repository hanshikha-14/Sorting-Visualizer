The Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application designed to help users understand and compare various sorting algorithms through interactive visualizations. By animating the sorting process, it provides an intuitive way to grasp the mechanics and performance of algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.

Features
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Visualize Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.
Interactive Controls: Adjust the array size and sorting speed to observe algorithms under different conditions.
Real-Time Animation: Watch as elements move and swap, providing a clear understanding of each algorithm's behavior.
Responsive Design

Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, DOM Manipulation

How It Works
Generate Array: Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new random array of integers.
Select Algorithm: Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Adjust Settings: Use the sliders to modify the array size and sorting speed.
Start Sorting: Click "Start Sorting" to initiate the visualization. Watch as the algorithm sorts the array step by step.
Observe Results: Once sorting is complete, analyze the sorted array and compare performance across different algorithms.
